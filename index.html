            <p> Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) were once said to mirgrate from Asia and made their way to the west coast of North America over 50,000 years ago where they lived down through the Rocky Mountains, California and parts of Mexico. Due to climate change these bears have made their way into the northwest corner of the continent and are living in current day Montana through Canada and Alaska.</p>

            <p>The area an animal uses in pursuit of its biological requirements is referred to as a home range. In inland Alaska, on average a bears home range is 521 square miles whereas bears who lives along the coast in salmon-rich rivers will only have a home range of about 10.5 square miles.</p>

            <p> Bears that live along the coast tend to be larger and darker in color, whereas bears that live inland are smaller and lighter in color. Grizzly bears have round faces and stubby ears. Their front paws have long, strong claws that help the bear dig and hunt prey.</p>

        <div class="col3">
            <p>Grizzly bears also have a large hump of muscle on their back connected to their shoulders. This muscle gives the bear its strength. Like most bears, Grizzlies have extremely powerful jaws.  Being one of the biggest bears, adult females can weigh up to 800lbs and adult males can weigh up to 1,700lbs.</p>

                <p>Once the bear is a couple years old it will go off on its own. Grizzlies prefer to wonder alone. Males are extremely territorial and will mark their range heavily; usually done by urination, scratching trees, or loud roaring. Males are very aggressive when it comes to finding a female to mate with. They will fight other males to win over the female. They will also fight with females who will not mate with them. They do not like the bear cubs. The males will often try to kill young cubs to eliminate competition.</p>

         <div class= "col3">  
             <p>Grizzly bears are omnivores and their diet varies widely. They may eat seeds, berries, roots, grasses, fungi, deer, elk, fish, dead animals and insects. Bears spend most of their time eating plants. About 90% of their diet is pants. Early spring is the hardest time for a bear to find food. Grizzly bears will be very hungry after hibernating all winter and food supply is very short during this time of year. During this time, bears will try to find berries that survived the winter or they will eat deer and elk that were killed.</p>

                  <p> *In the lower 48 states, grizzly bears are protected by law as a threatened species. It is illegal to harm, harass, or kill these bears except in the case of self-defense or the defense of others*
